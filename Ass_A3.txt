"""Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a 
transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following: D

withdraw and deposit) D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 
D 300, D 300 , W 200, D 100 Then, the output should be: 500"""
